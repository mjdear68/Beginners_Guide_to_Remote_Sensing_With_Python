    "# Beginner's Guide to Remote Sensing with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "These tutorials were developed after I completed a remote sensing project as a part of the Graduate Diploma in Science course with the University of New England. My intention at the start of the project was to use [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) as the main software. It soon became apparent that coding was more appropriate for the large time-series datasets with which I was working. Code also provides a record of the steps taken for future reference and efficient reuse. The data I was accessing from the [Digital Earth Australia (DEA)](https://www.dea.ga.gov.au/) data cube required me to begin learning Xarray and related Python libraries. Although I had some experience using the Pandas library from earlier data analysis projects, I was not a highly experienced Python programmer. Hence, I found myself on a very steep learning curve. Thanks to the excellent resources provided by the DEA and the Stack Exchange [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [GIS](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) communities, I was able to develop the skills necessary to complete my project. This series of tutorials has been designed for people who find themselves, as I did, with some coding and GIS experience, who need or want to approach remote sensing and spatial analysis from a coding perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tutorial is short and directed at completing a typical remote sensing task. The code is intended to be at a level accessible to people with minimal to intermediate Python experience. There are explanatory comments and references to further reading throughout each tutorial. I hope you find these tutorials beneficial to your remote sensing with Python journey.\n",

    "## Software\n",
    "These tutorials do not cover obtaining and installing the required software. There are many ways to obtain and install Python and its related libraries which is covered in detail elsewhere. Personally I have found installing libraries using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) package manager to be an easy solution, although choosing a large distribution such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) might be the best method if you are not experienced using command-line applications. \n",
