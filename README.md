# Beginner's Guide to Remote Sensing with Python

## Introduction
These tutorials were developed after I completed a remote sensing project as a part of the Graduate Diploma in Science course with the University of New England. My intention at the start of the project was to use [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) as the main software. It soon became apparent that coding was more appropriate for the large time-series datasets with which I was working. Code also provides a record of the steps taken for future reference and efficient reuse. The data I was accessing from the [Digital Earth Australia (DEA)](https://www.dea.ga.gov.au/) data cube required me to begin learning Xarray and related Python libraries. Although I had some experience using the Pandas library from earlier data analysis projects, I was not a highly experienced Python programmer. Hence, I found myself on a very steep learning curve. Thanks to the excellent resources provided by the DEA and the Stack Exchange [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [GIS](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) communities, I was able to develop the skills necessary to complete my project. This series of tutorials has been designed for people who find themselves, as I did, with some coding and GIS experience, who need or want to approach remote sensing and spatial analysis from a coding perspective.

Each tutorial is short and directed at completing a typical remote sensing task. The code is intended to be at a level accessible to people with minimal to intermediate Python experience. There are explanatory comments and references to further reading throughout each tutorial. I hope you find these tutorials beneficial to your remote sensing with Python journey.
